     <h2><b> ByteCodeLearners Club</b> was founded in 2019 by 4 CSE students when
        they were in their 2nd year of college.
        <br /> The main motive to start such a community was that being from a
        Computer Science background they were very much interested in coding and
        development.
        <br /> In the beginning, when they started their development and coding
        they found themselves confused at so many places and there was no such
        community in their college to help them. <br />
        They all decided to start a coding community for the coming freshers. So
        that they should not have to face all those difficulties and problems
        again that their seniors faced.
        <br /> They came up with a solution for their juniors known as
        BYTECODELEARNERS.
        <br /> The club was just started with 4 members from a classroom of the
        CENTRAL UNIVERSITY OF HARYANA.</h2>
